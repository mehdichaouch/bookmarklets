# My bookmarklets repo

[Here](https://gist.github.com/search?q=user%3Amehdichaouch+bookmarklet) you can found all my bookmarklets.

To use one, you can minify it with [Closure Compiler Service](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/) or any others tools.

Then add prefix `javascript:` like this:

```javacript
javascript:(function()....);
```

Lastly add this as a new bookmark, or edit an existing bookmark to add in the URL field.
